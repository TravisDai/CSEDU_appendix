# Appendix: Survey Questionnaire for CSEDU 2025 Paper  

This repository contains the appendix for the paper **"A Preliminary Investigation into Theory-Practice Barriers in Sino-New Zealand Undergraduate Computing Education"**, accepted at **CSEDU 2025**.  

## Overview  

The appendix provides the **Survey Questionnaire** used in the study, which was designed to investigate the barriers that students face in transitioning from theoretical knowledge to practical application in a **Sino-New Zealand undergraduate computing program**. The survey includes multiple-choice and open-ended questions to capture insights on student challenges, learning experiences, and engagement levels.
